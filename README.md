## Introduction
DefCon can be a very busy time with lots going on. We understand that and wanted to provide this repository as a place for speakers to share their slides, notes, ancillary materials, etc.

We hope that this will allow for the sharing of materials without the need to quickly write down a URL or take a blurry picture of a slide.


## How to Contribute
As a speaker who wants to contribute their slides, please submit a pull request to this repo. You pull request can be a link to your website/repo/etc or can contain the slides themselves.
